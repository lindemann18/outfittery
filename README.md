# Senior Front End Task
> Outfittery - Team NRG

Hello! If you're looking at this repository, it means you're considering work at Outfittery, and that's awesome! Thank you for considering working with us!

So, this repository is nothing but a simple boilerplate to help you setting up your front-end work environment for the task. It gives you access to pre-defined colors, directives, components, etc, that you might need during your task, besides showing you a bit of what we use at Outfittery.

There certainly is a lot of room for improvement. During your coding task, if you find anything that needs improvement, feel free to do it. If you could let us know about such improvements, it'd actually be awesome, as that'd allow us to continuously improve and hire more awesome people like yourself :)

## Running this app

After cloning the repo, just...

* `npm i` - to install the dependencies
* `npm start` - to, well, you know, start the app :)

Once you've started the app, just browse to http://localhost:8099/ and you should see an example landing page.

## Project structure

### src/app
Inside this folder you'll find all code that is being used to render the landing page. This is where you should create your files to work on this task.

### src/app/components
You'll find six components under this folder but feel free to create more if you need.

### src/app/config
You'll find two configuration files under this folder *config.js* and *routing.js*.

### src/app/controllers
Inside this folder there is just one controller, for the landing page. But feel free to add your own controllers, if you want.

### src/app/styles
You'll find three *.sass* files which contains the sass (css) related to our app but feel free to add more files and sass code if you need.

### src/app/env and src/app/shared
Inside these folders you'll find a lot of different kind of resources. Just ignore them for now. Most of them are used to render the landing page and you don't need to touch them at all but feel free to change it if you want.
